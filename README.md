## Project Description
---
Code development for given tasks/assignments that includes a conversion from 'm' to 'M' and vice versa. In the second part of the assignment, all letters or the alphabet are to be converted from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa. The inputs are taken from a certain file and outputted onto another file. Refer to Files Information.

## Files Information
* mM Task Files
     * Takes an input text file  and converts all the m's to M's and all the M's to m's to the output file.
       * Input file = KLSadd.tex
       * Output file = mMoutput.txt
* aZ Task Files
     * Converts a-z to A-Z and A-Z to a-z for the same input that you used for the mM task.
       * Input file = KLSadd.tex
       * Output file = aZoutput.txt
---
## Pre-Requisites and Execution
1. Data Input - Input file for both programs must be named as "KLSADD.tex".
2. Computation - Each of these tasks (mM and aZ) contains two files (The program itself along with the input file.) for its execution, where these are placed in the same Workspace directory. The output file (as mentioned in the Files Information) is created once the program is run.
3. Execution - The Java software is needed to execute the program.

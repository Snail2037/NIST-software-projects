Project Description: Code developing
```
## Files Information
---
* mM Task Files  
     * Takes an input text file  and converts all the m's to M's and all the M's to m's to the output file.
       * Input file = KLSadd.tex
       * Output file = mMoutput.txt
* aZ Task Files
     * Converts a-z to A-Z and A-Z to a-z for the same input that you used for the mM task.
       * Input file = KLSadd.tex
       * Output file = aZoutput.txt

## Pre-Requisites
---
1. Data Input - Some method of obtaining user input checked to ensure that it is acceptable data, and exception [User interface]
2. Computation - Performed after employing the data collected in #1. In many cases, this code does not have to be developed by scratch. 
3. Data output - The result of the computation is displayed; [User interface function]
## Technologies
